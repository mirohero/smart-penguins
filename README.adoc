Version 0.8.540

FruityMesh is the reference implementation of the **BlueRange** initiative. It was the first open source implementation of a mesh network that is based on standard *Bluetooth Low Energy connections*. In contrast to meshes that use advertising and scanning, this allows for a network run with *battery powered* devices. FruityMesh works with the Nordic nRF51 or nRF52 chipset in combination with the *S130/S132 SoftDevices* and enables tons of devices to connect to each other with its auto-meshing capabilities. It is *always connected* with configurable connection intervals of *7.5 ms to 4 seconds* while still being able to run on batteries.

== News
This release should bring a lot of stability improvements and can now be compiled for the nRF52840 using SDK15. Our new Simulator did not make it in this release, though, as it needs some cleanup until we can make it available to everybody. We are planning to provide a changelog in the future, but for now, take a look at the documentation to find out more.

* Many bugfixes and stability improvements
* Improved clustering
* Better automatic TimeSync between nodes
* Adds Nearby Enrollment
* nRF SDK 15.2 integrated
* Generic Sensor & Actuator messages
