= Specification

Most parts of the protocol should not be modified to
enable interoperability. Some of the protocol decisions are found on
this page and ongoing discussions will show whether some of these
specifications should be changed.

== Advertising Packets
FruityMesh uses a number of advertising packets,
the most important one being the _JOIN_ME_ packet that is used for
discovery of nearby nodes that also run FruityMesh.

=== Advertising Packet with Manufacturer Specific Data
There are two types of advertising packets used by FruityMesh. One uses the manufacturer specific advertisement structure, the other uses the serviceData advertisement structure.

|Bytes|Type|Name|Description

|3|advStructureFlags|Flags|Mandatory Flags Adv Structure
|4|advStructureManufacturer|Manufacturer Data|Manufacturer Specific Adv Structure with 0x024D as company identifier.
|1|u8|_meshIdentifier_|Identifies this as a mesh advertising packet
|2|NetworkId|_networkId_|The network ID of this node
|1|u8|_messageType_|Used to identify a number of different advertising messages within the mesh
|===

==== Manufacturer ID
The company ID 0x024D (M-Way Solutions GmbH) is registered with the Bluetooth SIG and may be used by any implementation that conforms to the latest specifications of the FruityMesh protocol.

==== Mesh Identifier
The mesh identifier is 0xF0. No other identifier shall be used. Future versions might change this identifier. The purpose of the mesh identifier is to enable different protocols under the same manufacturer ID.

==== Network Identifier
The network identifier can be changed by the user. In combination with the _networkKey_, this allows different meshes to co-exist in the same physical area. It is set either during flashing or during enrollment.

==== Message Type
The _messageType_ is used to distinguish between different messages. The same _messageType_ definitions are used for advertising packets and for connection packets. This allows us to send the same message over another "transport" if desired and compatible with the message format.

=== JOIN_ME Packet (MessageType 1)
The _JOIN_ME_ packet contains all the information that other nodes can use to determine their best connection partner. The _messageId_ in the header must be set to 1. Future _JOIN_ME_ packets can have a different _messageId_ and different values that can then be used in the Cluster Score Function. The current implementation uses the _clusterSize_ and the number of _freeIn_ and _freeOut_ connections.

|2| u16 |_meshWriteHandle_| The GATT handle for the mesh communication characteristic
|4| ClusterId |_ackField_| Contains the acknowledgement from another node for the slave connection procedure
|===

=== Advertising Packet With Service Data
Another type of advertising packet used by FruityMesh uses the Service Data Adv Structure. This is important when dealing with mobile devices since some have hardware filtering with no support for manufacturer specific data.

=== Other Advertising Packets
FruityMesh can be used to distribute all advertising packets that conform to the BLE specification. These can be Eddystone, iBeacon or any other kind of advertising messages. These are however not essential for FruityMesh itself and are therefore not documented here. Have a look at the <<AdvertisingModule.adoc#,AdvertisingModule>> for more information.

== Connection Packets
The mesh uses a number of packets that are sent
over connections. Most packets that are sent over connections must have this header. There are some exceptions to this (e.g. split packets use a two byte message header for less overhead. The _messageType_ is used to identify if the _connPacketHeader_ is used or not.

|2| u16 | _senderId_ | Node ID of the sender
|2| u16 | _receiverId_ | Node ID of the receiver
|===

=== Module Connection Packet Header
Modules use an extended message header to guarantee that there are no collisions between different functionality. This extended header is used for the following messageTypes:

.Messages in extended package header
[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|MessageType|Name|Description

|51 / 0x33|`MESSAGE_TYPE_MODULE_TRIGGER_ACTION`|A request for a node to perform an action
|52 / 0x33|`MESSAGE_TYPE_MODULE_ACTION_RESPONSE`|Response message for a previous request
|53 / 0x33|`MESSAGE_TYPE_MODULE_GENERAL`|An event that does not need a response
|===

The following describes the format of the extended header:

.Format of a connPacketModule extended header
[cols="1,2,2,3"]
|===
|Bytes| Type| Name| Description

|5|connPacketHeader |_header_| The standard _connPacketHeader_ used for all messages.
|1|u8 |_moduleId_| The id of a module, a module provides different functionality for one specific task.
|1|u8 |_requestHandle_| A handle that can be used e.g. like a counter. Responses will always be returned with the same handle given in the request.
|1|u8 |_actionType_| This is the type of action that should be executed by the module. An individual list of _subCommands_ is available for each of the _messageTypes_ given above. E.g. there could be a `MODULE_TRIGGER_ACTION` message with the _actionType_ set to 1 (PING) to execute a ping. The response would be a `MODULE_ACTION_RESPONSE` message with the _actionType_ set to 1 (`PING_RESPONSE`).
|...|u8[] |_data_| additional payload data for the command
|===

== Node ID
A node ID (_nodeId_) is a way of addressing devices in a network. Each
device in a network must have a unique _nodeId_ assigned to it that must
not clash with the node ID of another device.

There are different node ID ranges that are used for different purposes:

.Node ID ranges
[cols="1,4"]
|===
|Node ID|Usage

|0| Broadcast address to reach all nodes in a network
|1...1999| Uniquely address devices (nodes, sinks, ...)
|2000...19999| Virtual addresses to address smartphones connected to the mesh
|20000...20999| Address groups
|30000| Address for the current node itself
|30001...30999| Specify the number of hops that a packet
can travel. (30 001 e.g. specifies that the packet must only reach the
direct neighbours)
|31000| Have a packet travel to the shortest sink
possible (not yet implemented)
|33000...39999| Assign nodeIds uniquely over multiple meshes for the same organization
|others| All other node IDs are currently reserved
|===

== Serial Numbers / SerialNumberIndex
The serial numbers are assigned
randomly using the _chipId_ when developing with the open source variant.
They should however be uniquely assigned using the UICR once devices go
into production. Contact M-Way Solutions GmbH before using serial numbers in production
with the M-Way Solutions GmbH manufacturing ID. The serialNumberIndex is a 32 bit
unsigned integer that can be uniquely mapped from and to a serial number
using the _GenerateBeaconSerialForIndex_ and _GetIndexForSerial_ methods in
the _Utility_ class.

== EncryptionKeys
There are a number of different keys used throughout
FruityMesh. These are all 128-bit keys and are used for AES encryption
between the nodes, as well as for communication with smartphones or other
devices.

=== No Key (FM_KEY_ID_ZERO = 0)
Can only be used if a node is not enrolled
and uses a key filled with all 0x00 for encryption.

=== Node Key (FM_KEY_ID_NODE = 1)
This key is used for the lifetime of
a device and is uniquely generated during production. It must be kept
secure because it allows full configuration access, e.g. enrolling and
removing the enrollment.

=== Network key (FM_KEY_ID_NETWORK = 2)
The network key is shared
between all nodes that belong to a mesh network. Whoever is in posession
of this key can configure all nodes in the network and can send any
message. It is important to keep this key secret, but it is
possible to change it if it is compromised.

=== UserBase Key (FM_KEY_ID_BASE_USER = 3)
This is a key that can't be
used to connect. It is used to derive all other user keys.

=== Organization Key (FM_KEY_ID_ORGANIZATION = 4)
The organization key
is shared between all networks of an organization. It allows access to a
limited set of functionality, e.g. necessary for tracking assets between
differen meshes. If the organization key leaks, it is necessary to
reconfigure all meshes of the organization.

=== Restrained Key (FM_KEY_ID_RESTRAINED = 5)
The restrained key is generated based on the node key. It is a
node key with limited access rights.

The "restrained key" can be derived from the node key by using an AES-128 bit
encryption by encrypting the ASCII-String "RESTRAINED_KEY00" (without
terminating 0) using the node key as the AES key. Example values are:

.Examples of node keys and "restrained keys"
|===
|Node Key | Restrained Key

|00:11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99:AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF|2A:FC:35:99:4C:86:11:48:58:4C:C6:D9:EE:D4:A2:B6
|FF:EE:DD:CC:BB:AA:99:88:77:66:55:44:33:22:11:00|9E:63:8B:94:65:85:91:99:A9:74:7D:A7:40:7C:DD:B3

|===

=== User Keys (FM_KEY_ID_USER_DERIVED_START = 10 to UINT32_MAX / 2)
The user base key is used to generate millions of user keys that
can be given to users or user groups. A user key allows access to a
limited set of commands and can be restricted in functionality depending
on the use case. If the _userBaseKey_ leaks, all _userKeys_ have to be
regenerated and distributed to users.

TIP: A key that is filled with 0xFF is considered invalid and cannot be
used.

== Device Types
There are different device types that are given to nodes with specific functionality:

.List of device types
[cols="1,2,4"]
|===
|DeviceType |Name |Description

|0 |DEVICE_TYPE_INVALID |Not used
|1 |DEVICE_TYPE_STATIC |A node that is installed somewhere with a
position that will not change much over time.
|2 |DEVICE_TYPE_ROAMING |A node that can move around freely.
|3 |DEVICE_TYPE_SINK |A node that is installed at a fixed place and
collects all the data (typically a MeshGateway).
|4 |DEVICE_TYPE_ASSET |A node that moves around and broadcasts its
presence so that it can be detected by a mesh.
|5 |DEVICE_TYPE_LEAF |A node that will only connect to the mesh as a
leaf but will not relay any data (Useful if its position changes but it
needs a constant data connection)
|===

== UICR
The UICR is a special persistant storage that is used to store
factory defaults once a node is flashed. The NRF_UICR->CUSTOMER area is
used to store the data on nRF chips.

If you want to store a serial number, _nodeKey_, etc. for a node, you
must write the UICR during flashing. The NRF_UICR->CUSTOMER area is used
for that purpose and starts at 0x10001080. You can use
http://srecord.sourceforge.net/[srec_cat] to produce a .hex file
containing the desired UICR data. This can then be merged with the SoftDevice and Application or you can flash each one separately.

FruityMesh will boot with random data (random _nodeId_ / _serialNumber_ /
...) if no data is present in the UICR. The data will however be
persistent across reboots as it is generated according to the internal chip id from the FICR. Layout of UICR memory:

|44|4|DEVICE_TYPE|Type of device according to <<Device Types>> |48|4|SERIAL_NUMBER_INDEX|Unique index that represents the serial number
|52|16|NETWORK_KEY|Default network key if preenrollment is used
|===

== Heap usage
Heap usage (malloc / new) is prohibited in the FruityMesh codebase. To ensure that this rule is followed, a linker flag for ld is used that generates a linker error if malloc is used. The error looks something like this:

`Make: new_op.cc:(.text._Znwj+0xe): undefined reference to `__wrap_malloc'`

If this happened to you, you have to remove the malloc / new usage.
