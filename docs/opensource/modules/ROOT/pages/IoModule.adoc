= IO Module (moduleId 6)

== Purpose

Driving and configuring all GPIOs. E.g. toggling a LED, a motor or reading values from a basic sensor.

== Functionality
The IO module only supports toggling of LEDs and
different pins at the moment. It will be extended to include support for basic sensors that can be read by e.g. analog/digital conversion.

=== Change LED Mode
Changes the LED mode to either on or off (depending on
configuration either off permanently or connection signaling)

[source,C++]
----
//Set led mode
action [nodeId] io led [mode = on / off / cluster]

//Switch leds on on all nodes
action 0 io led on
----

=== Set Pins
Sets a pin to either high or low output.

[source,C++]
----
//Configure pins low or high
action [nodeId] io pinset [pinNumber] [mode] ...

//Configure Pins 21 and 22
action 0 io pinset 21 high 22 low
----
