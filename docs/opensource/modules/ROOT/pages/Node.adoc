= Node

ModuleId 0

== Purpose

The node module is the central part of the FruityMesh algorithm. It is a
mandatory module. It is responsible for clustering and other mesh
related tasks and functionalities that are part of FruityMesh.

== Functionality

The node keeps track of all _MeshConnections_ and monitors connects and disconnects. It works in conjunction with the _MeshConnection_ and _ConnectionManager_ classes for this. The node is also responsible for broadcasting mesh discovery (xref:Specification.adoc[JOIN_ME]) packets. It also activates scanning if necessary and monitors the incoming discovery packets of other nodes. It creates new _MeshConnections_ to other nodes if necessary. A state machine is used to toggle between different discovery states.

The node only permits one mesh handshake at a certain time. During the handshake, both mesh nodes exchange information about their clusters and decide which cluster is the biggest one. The packets used are specified under <<Clustering Messages>>. During the handshake, a backup of the current cluster state is made and used throughout the handshake. After the handshake, cluster changes that happened in the meantime are sent to these connections. Updates of the cluster size or structure are also sent to all xref:MeshAccessModule.adoc[MeshAccessConnections].

TIP: There are a number of undocumented commands. These are mostly for debugging and there is no guarantee that they will be available in future builds.

== Reboot Message

On reboot, the firmware sends a JSON to the connected device, providing more information about the reboot. The JSON has the following structure:

[source,Javascript]
----
{
	"type":"reboot",
	"reason":3, //Integer, see below
	"code1":17, //Additional information, depending on the reason given. The valid codes are purposefully undocumented, as they are highly subject to change and are mainly intended to help firmware developers.
	"stack":128, //Stack address of the reboot, if available
	"version":80021 //Version of the firmware
}
----

The reason can have the following values:

[cols="1,2,5"]
|===
|Code|Name|Description

|0|UNKNOWN|Reboot reason is unknown. A typical case where this can happen is when the node lost power and thus was unable to save any valid reason. Note that the reason really is **unknown** and as such could be any other reason as well.
|1|HARDFAULT|A hard fault occurred on the device.
|2|APP_FAULT|Some runtime check of the firmware failed and the device rebooted.
|3|SD_FAULT|Softdevice crashed.
|4|PIN_RESET|The power reset button was pressed.
|5|WATCHDOG|The watchdogs were not fed.
|6|FROM_OFF_STATE|The node previously was turned off and is now turned on.
|7|LOCAL_RESET|The `reset` command without any additional parameters was used.
|8|REMOTE_RESET|The `action _NodeId_ node reset` command was sent to the node.
|9|ENROLLMENT|The reboot happened because of an enrollment.
|10|PREFERRED_CONNECTIONS|The preferred connections were set.
|200-255|USER_DEFINED|Some user defined reboot reasons.
|===

== Terminal Commands

=== Setting The Discovery State

`action [nodeId] node discovery [on / off]`

It might be necessary to switch the node's state machine into a
different discovery state. This can be done through the mesh and can be
used by a MeshGateway to turn off discovery once all enrolled nodes are
connected. This allows the node to use a very low power consumption if
scanning doesn't need to be active for other tasks.

Once the node loses a connection to one of its partners, it will
automatically switch discovery on again.

Examples

[source,C++]
----
//E.g. switch discovery off for all nodes
action 0 node discovery off
----

The response acknowledges the receipt of the command.

[source,Javascript]
----
{"type":"set_discovery_result","nodeId":123,"module":0}
----

=== Setting Preferred Connections

`action [nodeId] node set_preferred_connections [ignored / penalty] {up to eight preferred nodeIDs}`

Sets the given node IDs as preferred connection partners while meshing. Other partners will be either completely ignored or their cluster score gets a heavy penalty. Executing this command without any nodeID disables this feature. After saving the preferred connections, the node reboots after a delay of 10 seconds. The "ignored / penalty" parameter determines the behaviour regarding the unpreferred connection partners, meaning any node ID that is NOT in the associated list.

TIP: For a connection to happen, both connection partners have to set each other as a preferred connection partner. This means to set the preferred connections of a mesh, it is best to start at the leaves of the mesh.

WARNING: Using this command with the "ignored" parameter must be used with caution as using invalid or unreachable nodeIDs results in a state where the mesh can not be created. If this happened, there are two options: +
1. Flash the beacon. This erases the set preferred connections. +
2. Connect to the beacon via a mesh access connection and execute the command again with the correct parameters.

Examples

[source,C++]
----
//E.g. Sets the preferred connections of 123 to 17, 32 and 12. Other connections partners are ignored for meshing.
action 123 node set_preferred_connections ignored 17 32 12
----

The response acknowledges the receipt of the command.

[source,Javascript]
----
{"type":"set_preferred_connections_result","nodeId":123,"module":0}
----

=== Querying Device Capabilities

`request_capability [nodeId\\{0}]`

Requests the capabilities of the node with _nodeId_. The receiver then answers with several messages, each representing a single capability. After all capabilities are sent, the receiver sends a last message indicating the end of the transaction.

WARNING: A single capability message is a rather big message with 128 bytes in size. As such only a single node in the mesh should be queried for it's capabilities at a time, else the mesh would be put under heavy load. Broadcasting this command is not supported by the firmware for this reason. 

Examples

[source,C++]
----
//Requesting capabilities of node 4
request_capability 4
----

The receiver sends all its capabilities:

[source,Javascript]
----
{
	"nodeId":4,
	"type":"capability_entry",
	"index":0, // Ascending unique number for each capability
	"capabilityType":2, // 1: Hardware, 2: Software
	"manufacturer":"M-Way Solutions GmbH", // Up to 31 chars
	"model":"BlueRange Node", // Up to 52 chars
	"revision":"0.8.451" // Up to 31 chars
}
{
	"nodeId":4,
	"type":"capability_entry",
	"index":1,
	"capabilityType":1,
	"manufacturer":"Vendor GmbH",
	"model":"Super Fast Chip",
	"revision":"Full ASCII support <(^.^)> 4.1"
}
----

And ends the transaction:

[source,Javascript]
----
{
	"nodeId":4,
	"type":"capability_end",
	"amount":2 // The amount of capabilities just sent. Can be used to check if all capabilities were received.
}
----

=== Sensor Values

[source, C++]
----
// Generate a sensor event and send through mesh
// (Only used for debugging)
component_sense [nodeId] [moduleId] [actionType] [component] [registerAddress] [dataHex] {requestHandle=0}

//E.g. broadcast sensor event for module 123 from component 7 and registerAddress 77
component_sense 0 123 0 7 77 AA:BB
----

Following low-level data structure transports sensor measurement values across the mesh.

[source, C++]
----
enum SensorMessageActionType {
    UNSPECIFIED = 0, // E.g. Generated by sensor itself
    ERROR_RSP = 1, // Error during READ/WRITE/...
    READ_RSP = 2, // Response following a READ
    WRITE_RSP = 3 // Response following a WRITE_ACK
}
----

[cols="1,2,2,4"]

|Bytes|Type|Name|Description

|5|connPacketHeader|header|
|1|u8|moduleId|The module that generated this value
|1|u8|requestHandle|Optional request handle, otherwise 0
|1|u8|actionType|One of the above actionTypes
|2|u16|component|Some number identifying the source of the measurements such as a lamp head (*vendor specific*)
|2|u16|registerAddress|An address used to differentiate data transported such as a hardware register number or a message profile id (*vendor specific*)
|1-...|u8[]|payload|Actual binary data that represents a sensor reading or multiple.
|===

The packet header consumes 12 bytes, which allows for 8 bytes of payload in a single packet and should be enough for most sensor values. For bigger payloads, it will be split.

The output on a sink is:
[source,javascript]
----
{
	"nodeId": 5,                // sender
	"type": "component_sense",  // discriminator
	"module": 123,              // moduleId
	"requestHandle": 0,
	"actionType" : 0,
	"component" : 7,
	"register" : 77,
	"payload": "abcdeQ=="       // base64 encoded
}
----

=== Actor Message

[source, C++]
----
// Instruct device to write data into a register address
component_act [nodeId] [moduleId] [actionType] [component] [registerAddress] [dataHex] {requestHandle=0}
----

The following message is used for transporting write or read requests through the mesh.

[source, C++]
----
enum ActorMessageActionType {
    RESERVED = 0, // Unused
    WRITE = 1, // Write without acknowledgement
    READ = 2, // Read a value
    WRITE_ACK = 3 // Write with acknowledgement
}

|2|u16|component|Some number identifying the destination for the action (*vendor specific*)
|2|u16|registerAddress|An address, e.g. hardware register number or a message profile id where the data should be written (*vendor specific*)
|1-...|u8[]|payload|For READ, this must be a singly byte that represents the number of bytes to read. For WRITE and WRITE_ACK, the payload is the bytes that should be written.
|===

No JSON representation is necessary for the moment as the meshgateway will not react on _act_ messages.

=== Getting Basic Information (Local Command)

`status`

It is very conveniant to get easily readable information about a node.
The status command displays the currently active connections and their
state. It also display device information and the clustering state.

The following will be printed on the local terminal after the command
was entered:

....
Node BBBBB (nodeId: 1) vers: 80000, NodeKey: 01:00:....:00:00

Mesh clusterSize:10, clusterId:4201185286
Enrolled 1: networkId:10, deviceType:0, NetKey 04:00:....:00:00, UserBaseKey 00:00:....:00:00
Addr:00:00:00:01:00:00, ConnLossCounter:3, AckField:0, State: 1

CONNECTIONS 2 (freeIn:0, freeOut:2, pendingPackets:0
IN (0) FM 7, state:4, cluster:fa690006(8), sink:-1, Queue:0-0(0), Buf:1/7, mb:0, hnd:16
OUT(1) FM 10, state:4, cluster:fa690006(1), sink:-1, Queue:0-0(0), Buf:1/7, mb:1, hnd:17
....

=== Setting Terminal Mode (Local Command)

When working with UART (Terminal and UART must be enabled), FruityMesh
supports a convenient blocking terminal mode with echo back
functionality. For communication with another device such as a
MeshGateway, an interrupt based input method and JSON output is used. To
toggle between these two modes, there are two commands:

`startterm`

Using _startterm_ invokes a blocking mode where all functionality is
halted and user input is received in a busy loop until a line feed '\r'
is received. The command is then processed and other functionality
is resumed. The input is echoed back on the terminal.
Backspace is supported as well for most terminal programs. If the
command isn't recognized, a warning is echoed.

`stopterm`

The _stopterm_ command switches the node into an interrupt based input
mode where terminal input does not affect the functionality until a line
feed '\r' is received. All output messages are in JSON format.

== Rebooting (Local Command)

`reset`

To reset the node via the terminal, enter this command
and a software reboot is performed.

== Time Synchronization

To synchronize a time over the mesh, the
time needs first to be set on the local node using the _settime_ command.
The time is stored internally as an unsigned 32-bit integer.

`settime [u32 unixTimestampSec] [i16 offsetMinutes]`

Afterwards, the time of the local node can be queried using:

`gettime`

The output gives the current time and date of the node in a
human-readable format. This is only an approximate
calculation. It is just to verify if the time was set correctly.
Internally, the nodes work with Unix time stamps.

== Querying Active Modules

`get_modules [nodeId]`

Often it is necessary to get a list of modules that are available on a
node. The list provided by the _get_modules_ command includes
all modules that are available
(compiled into the firmware): their _moduleId_, their version and whether
they are currently active.

[source,Javascript]
----
{
    "nodeId": 1,
    "type": "module_list",
    "modules": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "version": 2,
            "active": 1
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "version": 1,
            "active": 0
        },
        // ...
    ]
----

== Sending Raw Data

=== General Overview

image::raw_data_flow.png[]

Sending raw data can be used to send any arbitrary data, e.g. zip files. The data to be sent is split into chunks that are then sent through the mesh. The data to be sent is called the "payload".

Every raw data transaction (except _raw_data_light_, which will be explained later) starts with a _raw_data_start_ message. This message includes the amount of chunks in the transaction and the protocol of the payload. Once the receiver receives this message, it answers with a _raw_data_start_received_ message, which indicates to the sender that the receiver is ready to receive the chunks.

When the sender receives the _raw_data_start_received_ message, it starts sending all _raw_data_chunk_ objects. In addition of payload data, every _raw_data_chunk_ includes a chunk ID, which is a unique (regarding the current transaction) ascending number, starting at 1 for the first _raw_data_chunk_ object. chunk ID 0 is reserved for the _raw_data_start_. Using this chunk ID, and the information of the amount of chunks form the _raw_data_start_ message, the receiver is able to determine the last chunk in the transaction. Once it receives the last chunk, it reports back to the sender using a single _raw_data_report_. This message includes the chunk IDs of up to three missing chunks. If all chunks were received, the list of missing chunks is empty, which tells the sender that the transaction was successful. If however, the list of missing chunks is not empty, the sender must send the chunks with the corresponding chunk IDs again. The last chunk IDs of the previous _raw_data_report_ message acts as a last chunk, regarding the sending of additional _raw_data_report_. This sending of _raw_data_chunk_ and _raw_data_report_ is repeated until _raw_data_report_ has an empty list of missing chunk IDs.

All devices involved in the communication (sender, receiver, and the mesh) are able to cancel the communication by sending a _raw_data_error_ message to the sender as well as the receiver. If the sender or the receiver is the device that hung up the transmission, it is allowed to not send the error to itself. The _raw_data_error_ message includes an error code, indicating the reason for the cancellation. It is possible to receive a _raw_data_error_ message without an open transmission. This can happen if the sender cancels the transmission using a _raw_data_error_, but this error is dropped during the transmission. The receiver then might send another _raw_data_error_ indicating a timeout while the sender already canceled the communication. Such messages without an open transmission may be discarded.

=== Dropped Messages

As any other message in the mesh, every message in the raw send protocol could be dropped. This section describes how an implementation must behave in such scenarios. It also describes the obligations of the sender and the receiver.

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Dropped message | Reaction

|raw_data_start +
raw_data_start_received | The sender must send the _raw_data_start_ again after a timeout of 10 seconds or stop the transmission. The receiver has to be able to handle several successive _raw_data_start_ messages with the same content (in case the _raw_data_start_received_ message is dropped) and close a dropped connection after a timeout of 15 seconds (in case the sender does not send another _raw_data_start_).
|raw_data_chunk | Missing chunks are reported in _raw_data_report_ once the last chunk is received. These missing chunks must be resent.
|Last raw_data_chunk or raw_data_report | Using the ChunkID, both sender and receiver are able to identify the last data chunk. If this message or the _raw_data_report_ are dropped, the sender must send the last chunk again. This means that the receiver is only allowed to save the last chunk ID once the first chunk after a _raw_data_report_ is received, not immediately after the _raw_data_report_ is sent.
|raw_data_error | If a _raw_data_error_ message is dropped, the sender or receiver has already canceled the transmission, leading to the sending of another _raw_data_error_ upon receiving an invalid out-of-transmission message or a _raw_data_error_ indicating a timeout. In the rare cases where the origin of the _raw_data_error_ is the mesh itself, it could happen that both _raw_data_error_ messages are dropped. In such cases the connection is still up, but will probably create another _raw_data_error_ once the ill-formed chunk is sent again.
