= Enrollment Module (moduleId 5)

== Purpose

New nodes are normally flashed without a `networkId` assigned (set to 0). This means they will not connect to a mesh as long as they are not enrolled. The term enrolled is used in synonym with provisioned or commisioned.

In order to assign a node to a mesh, the user has to give a `networkId`, the `networkKey` and a unique `nodeId` for this mesh. This can be done by a MeshGateway or a dedicated enrollment app. The enrollment packet should be sent to the broadcast address 0 and must contain to serial number of the node to be enrolled.

== Functionality

=== Enrolling Over The Mesh

The _EnrollmentModule_ supports enrollments over the mesh. A normal enrollment message is sent as a broadcast through the mesh together with the `nodeKey` of the node that should be enrolled. All receiving nodes of this message try - at a certain random percentage - to scan for this node. They temporarily store the enrollment data and connect to the node once it is found and enroll it. Also, at a certain random percentage, the node sends an enrollment proposal through the mesh that contains some nearby serial numbers that the MeshGateway might like to enroll.

If the message is sent to a specific `nodeId`, this node will try to scan for the other node with a 100 percent probability. This is useful if the nodes position is already known, e.g. by parsing an enrollment proposal.

=== Pre-Enrollment

The _EnrollmentModule_ supports _PreEnrollments_. A module can register itself using _SetPreEnrollmentHandler_. The _EnrollmentModule_ then calls this handler when an unenrollment or enrollment is received. The module then has a fixed time to perform an enrollment of other components, e.g. an external controller. Once it is done, it must call _SaveEnrollment_ so that the node enrollment is processed. If this is not called within a defined time, the enrollment will fail with the result code `PreEnrollmentFailed`.

=== Unencrypted Enrollment

If `allowUnenrolledUnsecureConnections` is set in the feature set and the node is in an unenrolled state, nodes accept connections with `FM_KEY_ID_ZERO` for enrollment. This allows an easier enrollment process.

WARNING: Such nodes should never be used in an environment where unauthorized people have access because these people also have easy access by design.

=== Different Enrollment Scenarios

==== Unenrolled Node

If the `defaultNetworkId` (flashed into UICR) is set to 0 and no enrollment configuration is present, the node is unenrolled and the node module is inactive. Enrollment is possible by connecting using a _MeshAccessConnection_ with the node key and sending the enrollment data.

==== Node Enrolled Into A Different Network

If the node was previously enrolled into a different network, the user might not have access to this network. The node module is active and searches for other nodes in the same network. It is still possible to connect by using a _MeshAccessConnection_ and send a different enrollment to the node.

==== Node Enrolled Into The Same Network Or An Enrollment Network
If the `defaultNetworkId` is set to 1 or any other ID known by the MeshGateway, we can send a new enrollment through this enrollment network and the node will pick it up and will reboot into the new network.

=== Default Enrollment
The data stored in the UICR defines the default enrollment of a node. If a node is assigned to `networkId` 0 by default, it doesn't participate in the mesh until it is enrolled. If a node is assigned another `networkId` and `networkKey` as a default, it tries to connect to the mesh after it is flashed. Resetting the node reverts the node back to its defaults.

//Enroll a node

//Enroll BBBBB into network 7 that already has nodes 1 and 2

//Enroll node BBBBB into network 5 over the mesh with new node id 2
//networkKey will be 11:..., userBaseKey 22:..., orgaKey: 33:...
//nodeKey is given so that enrollment over mesh can connect securely to the node

=== Removing An Enrollment
Removing an enrollment from a node will reset all settings to default (factory reset). The node will return to its default network.
[source, C++]
----
//Remove an enrollment
action [nodeId] enroll remove [serialNumber] {requestHandle}

//E.g. removing the enrollment of the node with serial number BCBCF
action 0 enroll remove BCBCF

|7 bit|timeoutSec (optional)|Enrollment over the mesh uses a timeout how long a node will try to look for the to-be-enrolled node. A good default value is 10 seconds which will result in a maximum of 14 seconds time for an enrollment. (Sending 0 will use the default value)
|1 bit|enrollOnlyIfUnenrolled (optional)|If set to 0, the enrollment will be done even if the other node is already enrolled. If set to 1, the node will generate an error response for the enrollment (ENROLL_RESPONSE with error code .

==== Response
Randomly and if available, a node might respond with an enrollment proposal that contains a number of nearby serialNumberIndexes. If the MeshGateway wants to enroll one of these nodes, it can send a directed message to this node to enroll the other nearby node. If a serialNumberIndex is 0, there were not enough nodes around or not yet scanned.
