= Simulator

____
The Flash simulator shows a very early stage of our mesh development. It
is useful for showing the mesh basics, but does not reflect the current
state of our implementation. Have a look at <<CherrySim.adoc#,CherrySim>>
for our new simulator.
____

A mesh simulator is available in the `fruitymesh/sim/` folder that
demonstrates the functionality of the algorithm. You can start it by
either executing the .swf file directly or by opening the html page.

== Usage
The simulator starts with a basic configuration that
contains a few nodes. The _ClusterScore_ is calculated by using solely the
_clusterSize_ and the free connections that a node has. The simulation is started by clicking on *Start Advertising*. The nodes then
advertise to their neighbours and connect or disconnect based on
the algorithm. You can see some statistics in the text box in the lower
left. You can find info about the individual nodes by hovering over them
with your mouse cursor.

For more detailed information on the algorithm have a look at
xref:The-FruityMesh-Algorithm.adoc[The FruityMesh Algorithm].

=== Modifying Nodes
A number of random nodes can be created by
entering their number and clicking on *Create Random Nodes*. Moreover,
you can add a new node by double-clicking anywhere in the empty space of
the simulation. Nodes can be moved via drag and drop. Their transmit
range can be modified by hovering over the node and rotating the mouse
wheel. Removing a node is achieved by `Alt + Mouse click`.

=== Importing & Exporting Node Configurations
You can export a JSON of
the current node configuration and copy/paste it in a text
editor for later use.

=== Send Data
To send a data packet through the mesh, use
`Ctrl + Mouse click` on any node. Data flow is illustrated as
green flashing arrows in one direction and blue flashing arrows in the
other direction.
